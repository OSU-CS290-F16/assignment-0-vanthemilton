    		<p>This assignment didn't prove to be very difficult in the end, but it was a bit overwhelming for me. I've only dabbled in html and the github user interface isn't intuitive to me yet. Had to delete and reupload a file to my assignment 0 repository simple because I couldn't figure out how to rename it... I also have the feeling of not knowing where to start. Five tabs open shifting for what to do, it felt chaotic. Looking forward to in class instruction to boost my confidence.</p>

    		<p>The linked html tutorial was a little helpful, and Piazza has the potential to be a great tool. Not fond of the thousands of emails I get from all of the different resources that my classes require me to use though.</p>

    		<p>And for the record, I used Sublime Text editor to write this.</p>
